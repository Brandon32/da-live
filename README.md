Dark Alley is a research project.

## Getting started

### TL;DR
1. Clone this repo to your computer.
1. Install the [AEM CLI](https://github.com/adobe/helix-cli): `sudo npm install -g @adobe/aem-cli`
1. In a terminal, run `aem up` this repo's folder.
1. Start coding.

You will need to run [DA Admin](https://github.com/auniverseaway/da-admin) locally as well. This is so you can develop the server APIs in parallel with the UI.
